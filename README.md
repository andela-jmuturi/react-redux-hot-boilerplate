# react-redux-hot-boilerplate
A boilerplate featuring React and Redux with react-hot-loader and Webpack.
Keeping this here because I'm too lazy to be building React projects from
scratch every time.

# Installation
1. Clone this repository

    $ git clone https://github.com/andela-jmuturi/react-redux-hot-boilerplate.git

2. In order to run this boilerplate in development mode, run

    $ npm run start:dev

which will start the webpack dev server. The dev server is started with hot
module reloading capabilities.

This is pretty much WIP and although it's configured with production mode in
mind, it doesn't have a production server just yet.
